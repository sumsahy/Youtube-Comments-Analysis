@titanax1390,"I like the live version with Sir Bob Geldof and then the other live version with, the late great, Sir David Bowie. The ""Pulse"" version of this song is IMO the best ever. Live8 whilst good for what it was, delivered the album version of ""Comfortably Numb"" without the guitar embellishments. This version is fine nowhere near as good mainly due to loss of Richard Wright. I really dislike it when the crowd sing along."

they will recommend you some are good so you listen to it. it is good and you like it....... so this song was not recommended to me.I listened to their other songs..... one day. I was riding bike went home. this tune captured my mind. it was a era I came to here all alone and I was not sure about life. this music shaped my memories to that era.
also,I gotta say. music is more important than friends.   your friend and your lover will betral and leave you.... but your music wont... they are your only friend..... ok it is sad to admit.....😂😂😂😂 Hopefully I can have a higher hopes for me.😊"

I want to thank you for all you have (probably unknowingly) done for me and for so many other people. Growing up i never understood why my father would sit in the dark with his favorit drink and play your music so loud that we would wake up. We never went downstrairs because everyone knew that this moment was for my father alone. Now many years later i understand.....i can feel it too. He has passed so i can't thank him anymore for bringing your music into my life so instead, i thank you Mr. Gilmour."

Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax (relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become

I grew up loving Maiden, Iced Earth, Metallica... Petrucci, Satriani and many others. I even started playing guitar myself and never learned this song.
Now today... I wish I would have learned that solo to play it once for him. Even if I would have sucked at it. But this is, definately, the best solo ever written. He was right in the end."

@woutkoopman,"I wasn't raised on PinkFloyd so I found out about them later in life. I've really tried to listen to them but it's just not really that good. The song is just mundane and boring for 4 minutes, with bad lyrics, and the guitar solo is novice level guitar playing. An 8 year old can do that after a year of lessons. I'm not impressed. Watch ""telegraph road"" by Mark Knopfler if you want to see some real emotional great guitar playing."

NYC Mayor, 2025. No crime, no traffic, no poverty, no homeless. Heal the mentally ill. 
Our intentions are always good for us, and for everyone, of course. But, we really don't do anything to make any of that happen. Good for us, and for everyone. We sit back and do nothing. About anything, at all. And, I always think because, I'm always thinking. I think like, can you just imagine...?, what we can do? Wow... We are people on this planet, called Earth. Well, it's called Earth in America but not in any other Country in the world. Now, that is a problem right there. What really is the name of so you call Earth? That's the name of it, Earth, really? Just because you say so? Floating in space. And then you call it God. Unknown creatures, to ourselves, living in this Country and call it, Earth. And let me not even go there because It's not even Earth. 90% of it is water. And then, exactly what is expected of us on this you call Earth? But we are here. Civilization, I think that has slowly progressed but still a long way to go at our very slow mental development, so it takes much longer, the longer we deny and procrastinate. 
The planet needs our mental progression . We are very far from it. Why?, because we are ignorant creatures to believe it, put any effort in it, and fight each other to deny it. 
God has so many names and please, let me not even go there, it's so many of them but yet, we all agree that there is only one God, right? But, why does God have, soooo many different names??? Is he a Tricker? A Joker? Why does God not have only one name? Well, because of everything else in this very sick world. Like religion, for example, and the reason we all fight and want to kill each is because God has so many different names, and because of so many religions, in this, STILL A VERY PRIMITIVE and VERY SICK WORLD.

Ahí fue dónde vi lo qué era música. Al qué no le guste por mí qué sé valla a tomar por culo

Con el tiempo todo sé va hasta qué lo recuperas sin darte cuenta  o lo que sea ,sólo quiero decir qué pink floyd es la música, y e escuchado a lo largo muchos tipos de música, y sí me han gustado claro.

@Afreshio,"God fuck... 

It's been YEARS since I heard this. Avoiding this one and many many songs because you know what happens when you share music tastes and experiences with the one you love/loved and then you breakup, what's gonna happen with the memories and your love for the song? 

Intermingled in pain.

The theme of this song it's about melancholy, loss, reminiscence, sadness, acceptance... all through the lense of adiction I think.
 
It's kinda adyacent with what's happening to me, especially when something triggers memories from those happy years with her...

I've been dealing with a kind of comfortable numbness situation myself. It's a cope mechanism to not get hurt again. It was my first and only love so far. It lasted for almost a decade. We lived through everything: good, bad times, country collapsing, inmigration and assimilation of another culture, fights, but mostly it was hugs, kisses, love... but sometimes possession, and all wrapped in co-dependence. It wrecks your soul. Especially when you have the emotional maturity of a fucking neanderthal.

Damn do I miss those good days that I know are being seeing through a rose tinted lens. But I know that woman doesn't exists anymore. Those moments are in the past which doesn't exist either, as strange as it sounds to me right now. The past is over. Only the present is real, only the future is worth worrying about and only sometimes."

@ismailfawaz1807,"Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more ah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@lukesayers7140,I have been in love with this song and solo since I first heard it back in the early 80's. It just takes me to a very special place in my mind. My Grandad was in a hospice back in 1995 and this track came on the radio when I got into to my car after visiting him for what would be the last time I ever saw him. There are just no words to describe the feeling this song evokes in me. This is the song I want played at my funeral for its pure beauty. I don't think there is anything that will ever top this solo ever. Thank you DG!

How much professionalism do you want? All of it!"

The iconic sound of The Black Strat will never be forgotten.

@ddebenedictis,"Great musicians, but also an outstanding cinematic accomplishment.

In his interview, director Gavin Elder states the crew wasn't allowed to bring cameras onto the floor of the arena, so the stationary cameras were either on the sides or on cranes. They were allowed only one Steadicam but it had to keep moving, which made the shoot all the more difficult. They solved some of these problems by using a drone to capture some of the film's magnificent aerial shots from afar. The Italian authorities wouldn't let it fly over the actual amphitheater. ""We got shots from maybe a mile away"" David Gilmour says, smiling.

Knowing these tidbits makes rewatching this video a little more fun for me!"

רוחות הרפאים של אדם מקום וזמן.
ואין ידוע אם הרוח הייתה קיימת,
או שמא אגדה הייתה.
ובסוף קצה הערפל מתגלה רמז האמת.
ואין ידוע אם תהייה או הייתה.
אך הרוח לרגע חמקמק ממש קיימת,
לעולם להישאר.
והעין המתבוננת מתמלאת בירח זוהר."

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on (come on, come on) now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax (relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become
Comfortably numb"

@mikezooper,I’ve become comfortably numb to the fact that I was born an empathic person but almost noone else gives a crap. 49 now and cynical as fuck (I held off being cynical for 48 years; not bad). Thanks to the very small number of decent people out there. Forgiveness to the narcissists. I must heal from this pain (the pain of others not caring about other people).

His favorite band at the time was Pink Floyd, I ended up listening to some while I was in the belly.

@veljkoavramovic1485,"Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more (aargh!)
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working - good!
That'll keep you going for the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@diegovianavillegas3297,"I cab understand that playing the same song (Even being a masterpiece) for more than 40 years may be a little bit tyring, that's why Mr Gilmour morphs it into something different.

@andrewwarburton403,To release so much soul from an instrument youre playing is so moving. It's nothing short of perfection here with David Gilmour. It's pretty unbelievable how moving that guitar solo was even years later. Wish I had been there and hope all of Pompeii heard this. Utterly and undeniably one of the best and most captivating guitar solos in history.

I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more (aargh!)
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working - good!
That'll keep you going for the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

Not glorify it.
The Autotuned shit that and lyrics that a anyone could write that pass as current music compared to this classic are laughable,
It's not even funny that that today's music is so poor and lacks any originally,Ed Sheeran,really ,? Rhiannon,? Yeah great ,not remotely in the same league."

@bl00d_hound,I dont think David ever played Comfortably numb the same way twice.  He's been evolving it for 40 plus years and apart from the solo he played at Roger's 2011 gig at the O2 arena (personally I think David deliberately played it terribly) every version of this song is just epic.

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on (come on, come on) now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become
Comfortably numb"

The DVD registration is far superior in visuals and in sound. Why not just stand there and soak up this once in a life time experience. 

... ""But I was there, and have it on my own phone"" ... yes, with blown out audio, crappy video, and you missed out on The Solo, just because you were preoccupied with getting the thing recorded for yourself, dividing your attention between what is actually going on, and how it looks on your stupid little screen. Who are you recording it for anyway? For yourself to look back at? Probably not.... For your ""friends"" to show them where you are?  Really? That's more important than The Solo?! 

So sad."

@josephmotwani2929,"Ahead of performances by the likes of Allen Collins, Mark Knopfler,  Jimi Hendrix, Don Felder/Joe Walsh,  Brian May, Jimmy Page & Eddie Van Halen, & as voted on by the readers of Guitar Player Magazine in 2021,  The Greatest Guitar Solo of All Time was:
David Gilmour's legendary solo(s) in Comfortably Numb, from Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979).
And DG 's two solos in this Live at Pompeii version, esp. the four minute outro solo, arguably surpass those of even the studio album original & also probably surpass his solos in the live version by the briefly reunited Floyd that concluded Live 8 in July 2005, & that had the huge London Hyde Park crowd in raptures. A similar reaction here from the Pompeii crowd & from anyone watching this genius at work... including his bandmates."

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

No one would contest the magic of pink Floyd and David,  the revolution of the music began with them in the late 60's , playing pure music, clear sound , best symphony combinations ... this is what we call Art.
Thank you David and Co.
As I read below, kids...   record this , as you would probably never listen to pure music like what have achieved David and his band.

@ExiledGypsy,"Waters and Gilmour will one day be compared to Nietzche and Wagner with Comfortably Numb the apogee of their subconscious dialectic.
 
The seeds of their conflict were sawn long before they even met in their different childhood experiences.

Their inevitable divergence came about when Waters became aware of the impending explosion of the defensive wall that so many traumatised children make in order to survive leaving behind Gilmour enamoured with his own melodic craftsmanship allowed to flourish during childhood in a more stable family.

Off course, they were too young to understand it themselves. Gilmour could not see the pain of a man breaking down inside despite all the lyrics in the Wall album and called it too wordy that must have hurt Waters. He only saw the last desperate efforts of a man holding on and interpreted it as an uncompromising control freak. 

In turn, Waters never managed to shake off the arrogant and lonely self-belief that once helped him to survive. Neither did he ever admit that the Wall was autobiographical and now has turned into a political message.

If anyone has seen the film Whiplash they would get a hint of the dynamics that those two must have gone through in the last years of Pink Floyd.

I get the feeling that Gilmour still hasn't understood it and is more preoccupied with the guilt of leaving a friend behind, that those two shared with Syd Barret. Cross purposes of a strange kind."

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

Sadly however, Chuck Leavell's vocals, were absolutely dreadful & they nearly ruined this masterpiece of a song for me, if it wasn't for David Gilmour's mind numbingly amazing lead break (2), which was VERY much the same as The Division Bell Tour at Earl's Court in London, minus the Mirror Ball.

I also got a kick of the drummer just loving being there. Pushed the ""like"" button; what's NOT to like?"

@johncooper7785,That drummer is loving his job soooo much - love him
@jppagetoo,He skipped all the huge bends in the solo. He used slides and small bends instead. It's not bad but it's way different from how he used to play it and I think it loses something. Maybe he played it this way to change it up from the Pink Floyd approach. I love Dave but this isn't my favorite recording of him playing CN.

Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@christinesmilak8727,I agree. This solo is the best solo ever performed. Gilmore is in my book the greatest guitar player of all time. He is a man that doesn't brag or or flaunt his gift of guitar playing. He's is a man with a great gift who wants nothing more than to share it with the world. His guitar playing will go on forever. It's up to us to keep it going. Hats off to David. You are a true guitar god.

I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@jonhilderbrand4615,"When I was 6 or 7 years old, I had a really high fever and began to hallucinate or had a nightmare...a fever dream, perhaps. I could never describe it; the closest I've ever gotten to explaining it is like I was running from a gigantic, massive, near infinite ball of blackness rolling after me and I was always just inches away from being crushed by it as it rolled...all in slow motion. It was terrifying. Every once in a while, I catch a glimpse of that feeling. One time is when I saw a size comparison of the earth to the sun. A shudder ran up my spine, then it was gone. Weird thing is, I've always wanted to be able to hold on to that feeling so I could know it for what it was, maybe so I could face it and not be afraid anymore. 
So when you sing, ""When I was a child, I had a fever, my hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain, you would not understand,"" I want you to know...I understand."

If you love David on this tune, check out a young guy who is closest to David of anybody I’ve heard! “Andrew Korolev, Comfortably Numb” Take the time to check it out. I promise you won’t be sorry!!

I enjoy and appreciate the work of Page, Hendrix, and countless others, but I personally rate a guitarist not by how they play or how technical they are, but what I receive from it. David is the only guitarist who’s ever made me come to tears. Technically, Hendrix is probably hailed as the best, but I’ve never come to tears over his work. David’s work is timeless, it never gets old and it hits me right in the feelings every time I hear it. I can listen to this over and over and it will get me every time."

I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@brendacha1845,"My dad died from Covid19 on 14th April 2020, he was 64. Few years before, he told us he has made a playlist for his funeral. He wasn't sick, he was just thinking about his death one day and he probably didn't want silly music for his ceremony. Confortably Numb was his favorite song, ""the only one that makes me cry"" , he used to tell us. No surprise, it was at the top of the playlist, ""live version"" was written in parenthesis. During the pandemic, we couldn't have a proper funeral because everything was close from the church to the funérarium. We decided to send this playlist to all of our friend in every country and told them to listen to Comfortably Numb at 5pm, the time my father's body was supposed to enter the flame. We were 8 of my close family to sit in front of the crematorium with music speakers and all of our friend were connected  via video conference. Hundred of people have listen Comfortably Numb at the same time as a tribute to my father, an intense and powerful musical communion. I could imagine, listening to the solo guitar, my daddy's soul rising to the sky. It was blue and sunny. The best climb to paradise ever. I can't stop crying when I listen to it and as I do, I know my father is right above me. I love you dad 💗"

@STELLA7413,"Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

Корабль белый в дымке голубой. На горизонте , и волна играется с волной. Ты брат , не болен ли душой? А может, накурился гашиша? Не знаю отчего болит моя душа. Тогда я дам тебе укол. Здоров ты будешь так - хоть на танцпол. Ну ,  потошнит немножко , может быть . Зато не будешь одиноким волком выть. Не слышу я , ты что то говоришь? Был проблеск у меня, когда я был малыш. Я болен был и у меня был жар. Я превратился в маленький пожар. Но краем глаза видел я виденье . С тех пор  я глух к приятному оцепененью. Мечта ушла , ребенок вырос.

@kellyprice8246,This version is not bad. You can't dance to it thought like you can to the Scissor Sisters far superior take on this song. I feel they should get retrospective writing credits for improving the song so much.

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

I really like to listen to you in every variation of the original performance, in this one that is the most beautiful guitar solo in the world.
Comfortably Numb has only one flaw: it only last just over 9 minutes...
You should have been making a version of it for at least 30 minutes...
It would be great if you ""Returned"" to ""SAN MARCO"" Square in Venice (as in 2006), to CELEBRATE ""The END of the COVID-19 Pandemic"".
It would be EXTRAORDINARY and CONFORTABLY NUMB  would write in the HISTORY BOOKS,  the End of the Pandemic..."

@carlosluissanchez6490,"CONFIRMADO: GILMOUR NO ES HUMANO. Ningún humano en el mundo puede tocar como él. Cualquiera puede ser rápido; pero sólo Gilmour tiene esa virtuosidad y esa perfección para la pulsación de las cuerdas sobre la guitarra. Su sonido es único, y creo, firmemente, que ni siquiera es de este mundo. Si existieran los extraterrestres, David Gilmour, sería uno de ellos. La perfección no existe en el ser humano, pero David toca la guitarra de manera PERFECTA y logra crear un ambiente de otro mundo. 
CONFIRMED: GILMOUR IS NOT HUMAN. No human in the world can play like him. Anyone can be quick; but only Gilmour has that virtuosity and that perfection for the plucking of the strings on the guitar. Their sound is unique, and I firmly believe that it is not even of this world. If aliens existed, David Gilmour would be one of them. Perfection does not exist in the human being, but David plays the guitar PERFECTLY  and manages to create an atmosphere of another world."

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@MartinGonzalez-es7vm,"Lyrics:

Hello, is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, come on, I heard you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax, I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay, just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become comfortably numb"

@bkmeahan,"Funny thing is, when the wall came out, I didn't like this so song so strongly that I skipped over it long before the second solo.   Even decades later as I started playing guitar and constantly hearing how awesome the solo from CN is I only remembered the first solo and thought that isn't that big of a deal.    Only when my guitar teacher made me listen to the whole song did I realize what I had been missing all these years."

@markharrisllb,"I know Rolling Stone rated him something like fourteenth top guitarist of all time (very subjective), but he has to be the top all round package with his singing too. He’s got a far better voice than Clapton, Hendrix and even my favourite guitarist SRV.

When you mention PF to many people they instantly mention 'Another Brick In The Wall', to me that’s one of their weakest tracks after this, 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', 'Wish You Were Here' 'Mother' and several others. But what do I know? I think 'Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay' is one of Otis Redding's weaker songs.

I'm sorry but Roger Waters is a far better doctor, again very subjective but I think he’s much more ethereal."

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay (okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@duartx3500,"Doctor : Sorry, you have 5min to live.
Me : Listens to Comfortably Numb
Doctor : But that’s 9min.
God : It’s okay."
@lebastias,"Comfortably numb (Confortablemente adormecido) es un tema del álbum doble The Wall que la banda británica Pink Floyd lanzó a fines de 1979. El éxito comercial que tuvo el single Another Brick in The Wall (part II) opacó durante un buen tiempo la genialidad de ""Comfortably"", pero en la actualidad esta última suele ser considerada por muchos como la canción más emblemática del mítico álbum doble.
Los dos solos de guitarra que toca David Gilmour (en especial el segundo) son considerados como sus mejores solos en Pink Floyd y como unos de los mejores solos de guitarra de toda la historia; de hecho, la revista Guitar World lo situó en el número 4 de su lista de ""Los 100 mejores solos de la historia"". Además, en agosto de 2006, el solo fue votado por los espectadores de la estación de radio Planet Rock como el mejor solo de guitarra de la historia jamás grabado.
Recientemente un estudio ha demostrado que escuchar esta canción aporta beneficios para la salud mental y en otro estudio, realizado por el hospital de la Universidad de Cardiff, Gales, Reino Unido, se ha demostrado que esta canción es ""la más adecuada"" para oír durante una intervención quirúrgica.
En este espectacular registro, el último líder de Pink Floyd (la banda tuvo tres etapas, bajo tres líderes distintos), David Gilmour, acompañado de su banda solista, interpretan la canción en un recital que tuvo lugar en  la actual ciudad de Pompeya. Las ruinas cercanas fueron el escenario donde la banda grabó un famoso ""videoclip de larga duración"" en la época en que aún no se inventaban los videoclips musicales."

Went home, smoked a couple of cones and layed back, turned it up, and annoyed my family to hell. I was the youngest, so more influenced by 60's and 70's. And here I am at 59 an still loving this music. Timeless, last for ever. To me the Greatest Band ever due to the stories they wrote in their lyrics and their music abilities at such a young age. Remember that this song came out 51 years ago."

@Mauriziospag,"Comfortably Numb è il brano eccelso, il più amato dei Pink Floyd.
Parla ed intona il nero della depressione;
emozionante il senso della vita che resta appesa lì fuori, 
e preferisco affrontarla e lasciarmi ferire invece che non sentire nulla.
Sono un uomo, un uomo fragile ed insicuro ""la mia voce è sempre più distante dal corpo""
per questo ha tanto successo...
perchè è attuale, vivrà nel tempo e ci terrà in contatto con la realtà che viviamo.
Una visione fisica e anestetica il tratto testuale del brano:

...da bambino sono stato malato
Sentivo le mani gonfie come due palloni
Adesso provo di nuovo quella sensazione
Non saprei spiegarla, non capireste
Questo non sono io
Sono diventato piacevolmente insensibile...

""Una percezione di genio ed infinito""

Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now

هل يوجد احد هناك؟
مجرد إيماءة برأسك ان كنت تسمعني
هلأ القى اي شخص في وعيك؟
تعال الي الآن
سمعت أنك تشعر بالإحباط
حسنًا ، يمكنني تخفيف ألامك
وأضعك على قدميك من جديد
استرخ
أحتاج إلى بعض المعلومات أولاً
فقط الحقائق الأساسية
هل يمكنك أن تريني ماذا يؤلمك؟
لا يوجد ألم، كنت تتشافى
سفينة بعيدة ، تدخن في الأفق
و انت تأتي معها من خلال الأمواج
شفتيك تتحرك ولكن لا يمكنني سماع ما تقوله
عندما كنت طفل كنت أعاني من الحمى
شعرت بيدي وكأنها بالونان
والآن عادهذاالشعور مرةأخرى
لا أستطيع أن أشرح لك أنك لن تفهم
ليس هذا ما أنا عليه
لقد أصبحت مخدر بشكل مريح
حسنا.. حسنا
فقط وخزة ابرة صغيرة
لن يكون هناك المزيد من الاااه
ولكنك قد تشعر بالقليل من التعب
هل يمكنك ان تقف؟
أعتقد أنها تعمل ، جيد
هذه ستبقيك مستمرا في العرض
هيا حان الوقت للذهاب
لا يوجد ألم، انت تتعافى
سفينة بعيدة ، تدخن في الأفق
و انت تأتي معها من خلال الأمواج
شفتاك تتحرك ولكن لا يمكنني سماع ما تقوله
عندما كنت طفلا
لمحت نظرة عابرة
خارج زاوية عيني
إلتفت لأنظر لكنها اختفت
لا يمكنني وضع اصابعي عليهاالآن
كبر الطفل
ذهب الحلم
وأصبحت مخدرا بشكل مريح"

The only thing I wish was different about this song is that the guitar solo went longer. So good."

I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

You'll probably never read this but I'm a 25 years old guy, I got to know your music thanks to my grandpa and I'm so damn greatful. Your music is more than art, listening to you is like taking ACID, well actually doing both at the same time is like 8 hours of pure orgasms. I envy your family, for having the chance to have breakfast with such a divine person. Your parents were gods and I love them for creating you. And I love you for sharing your magic with us, my ACID times are behind, I'm married now and I'll make sure my dear daughter gets to know you some day, at least this song. Such an artist..."

@stefanominafra5102,"it is easy to forget ... perhaps it is legitimate that the new generations identify Pink Floyd with Gilmour, unaware of the history and the masterpieces that do not belong to David. However, I am surprised by the adults, those who know the band that dominated the late 60's and literally very well. the 70s until after the Wall with the last album of 83, also extraordinary in its singularity, sad, gloomy but beautiful in its implied anticipation at the end of the band. They continued after the defection of the true leader and creative genius Roger Waters, whose group has always identified itself after Barrett's abandonment, in the creative leader of Waters and in all the known masterpiece albums ... Gilmour has always suffered in silence the strong personality and talent of the leader and everyone knows that the band after the Wall could not go further, as an athlete or an artist squeezed to the core, for whom to stop or split is not easy ... but necessary. Gilmour insisted on keeping a band together trying to redeem for pure selfishness, his alleged hidden creative side ... but he has failed, tours full of special effects relentlessly, three bad and mediocre albums in over twenty years of activity and collections of songs in repetitive albums such as his concerts have not improved or fed the legendary and historical English band, but he has denigrated it ... an exceptional guitar is not enough to compensate for the creative genius he never had. Make a statistic of the work done by both and you know the truth, but I doubt that it will be useful..the truth is simple, Pink was the band to whose guide there was a leader, Barrett..for a couple or three years, Waters in the rest of their biggest success and ... A false leader, Gilmour, with excellent qualities. artistic as a guitarist and sometimes as a vocal mentor .. but the voice, the lyrics of the greatest masterpieces belong to Waters, unjustly underestimated by current fans. Make yourself a musical culture, Gilmour is a false leader who has created nothing, only collaborated in some text of the old band ... tours, collections of songs published for commercial purposes and special effects do not make him a Gilmour era, nor three albums in 20 years, a bad one and two mediocre ones, far from the original style ... ask yourself if they had changed their name, how everything would have changed, how the crowd would have reacted ... after Waters had been warned, retirement would have been the best solution of a bluff that deceived all the fans and denigrated the name of a band that contributed. to the history of rock ... Gilmour used the Pink Floyd label as an S.p.a, deceiving everyone, no one excluded, but not music criticism. Do you really believe that just your guitar, some old hit songs and grueling tours are enough to give the opportunity to show the world the old and flabby PINKs, without new ideas worthy of a band like that to revive and relive the old emotions and glories of the English band? Aching, reality is another"

@paulgibson8846,"I wrote the song from a real life and death experience. Music copy over from Navy Fed log infrasonic device.
Remember how Krushchev said he would win the war without firing a shot? He must of had the same device.
One simply points the infrasonic drum at another ship everyone kills each other on the ship except head intelligence the Captain but he is traumatized comfortably numb to be question!
You are only coming through in waves?
That is a US Navy ship turning on remote biosensors to make a positive ID after I disclosed my DoD code name to an approaching US ship not flying colors.
Morse code was my second language back then.
The ship captain wanted to ram his ship into shore so he could be heard by the media of his grudges with the Navy and I enhance his movement being a well known warrior with DoD a 311 Militia of Won.
Well, this getting to be long story but a lot 9f shit goes into the song scene. I desperately flash Morse code any man E3 or higher get to the bridge take over turn aft to shore your under my orders my promise you won't be court martial. One brave sailor did.
But the ship pulled anchor docked.
Follow me to my apartment, I told the captain I was a musician now falling away from Militia.
Captain says I got some mind sweeping music I want you hear.
So I'm sitting in the apartment their outside turn on their good ol Navy music I went wild began trashing the apartment then go into a coma, the neighbor s reported the broken glass people came running + a few band members and paramedics who gave me an overdose heroin because captain still hanging around might want to check how Brits treat for infrasonic shock.
Captain grabs the med report, your treatment might very well kill him! Oh I get it. Well off to the concert I walk on stage vomited grab the curtain fell down taking the curtains with me.
But that was not one ship that smokes 8t was an entire fleet thought Navy was after me for that.
So I wrote everything that happen into a song and that's it folks.

@FrancoisBusetti,"Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb..."

Now that everyone has the opportunity to see everything and everywhere sitting comfortably at home, it is bad to see those lucky few who have been able to see the concert, they are using their cell phones to film, instead of enjoying a unique event.

Hello? Hello? Hello?
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

No player in my 62 years can make me feel like Salieri in Amadeus ""looking through the cage of those meticulous ink strokes at an Absolute Beauty!"" Sorry. Gilmour has that effect on me. Don't mean to wax too rhapsodic....
On a side note I must say I like the guy singing the Dr's lines in this version of Numb better than even Waters. Something compassionate about him. Like that rarest of animals, an actual caring physician"

@doriscanham6929,what a privlidge it is for all these people to be in the same room with DAVID GILMOUR. I read somewhere the other day that a reporter asked Eric Clapton what it was like to be the greatest guitar player in the world and EC said i don't know you'll have to ask DAVID GILMOUR
@estheranderson5651,David Gilmore at his best he took blues scales to another level that makes him sound different from others that makes him one of the best guitarist in the world
@Krishanu,God

@gillesbebon3004,Tout simplement genial ... Gilmour au top quel solo !!!!
@mangaexmetal,I am speechless. This song goes so deep into my soul I can barely find words to describe it. Pure emotion. I saw Gilmour playing this masterpiece Live and  that day of his concert was definitely the best day of my life.

@dtenev1,just incredible
@l337g0g0,"Thank you David Gilmour for you love of music, and never stop sharing your talents and this beautiful music with the world, even after all these years.
It looks like you never want to stop sharing your passion with us.

When I listened to this the first couple of time(and it's still happening) the chills running threw my body were so immense, it was physical.
That feeling you get when you listen the greatest music being performed with someone who truly loves to share it, you feel it all threw your body and it never gets old.

We are all in a dept of gratitude to you sir."

@anitahardesty2163,So dam good!! No one makes such good music like this anymore!!
@GioSinatraFan,"After 56 spins on this earth, I've figured it out why I cry during a moment of greatness (whether it be a musical performance, a great moment in sports, or any incredible human achievement). When I witness perfection, I get overcome with emotion.  Joy for that person being right where they need to be and doing what they were born to do... Happiness because I've had the privilege to witness and experience that moment of perfection... Sadness because perhaps, I'll never see something that awesome again... Regret as I sometimes reflect on some of my personal goals never achieved... and Bliss because when you recognize you're witnessing a moment of pure greatness and perfection, you truly are the lucky one to have witnessed such a wonderful moment.  And when I feel that rush of all these strong emotions, my body has no choice but to well up in tears.  That makes me no less of a man... that makes me a proud member of the human race!"
@diogoleao850,Master!
@mendonsix,After the corona  waiting for Gilmour in Brazil SP
@kinan2934,The lights during the solo though... :0
@MsVix170,"Hi, David. Never happened in the world more than what we are experiencing in this period. Since I personally listen today, after having done it I believe this song for 10,000 times as I believe it is the basis, unconsciously contained within each of us, of the primordial origins of the sensations of the human race. I believe that in the same way you wrote this guitar solo, in the same way you interpret it and send strong positive emotions to the listener, you could give advice, your personal opinion, your opinion on what is going on today in the world, which manages to convey healing emotions to those who need it. thanks"

Why can't people just take the odd picture here and there, then put their phones away for the concert and actually enjoy the show.  You know, soak in the atmosphere, let the music envelop them, get the full experience that they paid big bucks for.  If you want to re-live the moment, there are ALWAYS great, well produced, live videos of ANY band on Youtube that you can then go watch."

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

@robertclarkguitar,"2 years in this coming june, I'll have been playing guitar (as a main instrument)  ....Thanks to David Gilmour and Pink Floyd. The only band I really listened to other than the stuff my bands over the years played. I was a drummer the past 26 ish years. Til katrina in 05. That bitch. Anyway. I raised my kids alone and when they grew up and moved out I was all alone as my dog had passed right before my daughter moved. I was alone with my keyboard missing drums so bad, I watched the pompei show and though I've seen it so many times I was drawn to the black strat. As though someone was trying to tell me something. All those years drumming. I never and I mean never thought i would be actually playing guitar and enjoying it as much as i have. 
Check my channel out and follow my little camper journey. All original Adlib playing from my little camper. Hahahah. Love atmospheric blues. Be well world. We pink Floyd fans are not Fans. We are the rare deep artistic tastes of emotional sound."

Suddenly, at 4:30, a subjective unknown reality explodes right before you, and you can't do anything but contemplate and try to keep yourself together. It's as if your brain were in the outer space and you could realize every single aspect of reality at that moment.

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

Believe it or not but this for me was the worst part of the whole cheating and it's something you just can't forgive.
Crazy how cruel life can be sometimes.


Now I feel seriously NUMB and all I can do is hoping that one day I'll be able to get Pink Floyd into my life again.

@andreaberardocco1151,number one in the world
@mat4410,There’s much more to guitar than shredding.
@mat4410,"I saw Pink Floyd perform back in ‘73, and now that is a very long time ago. And still, after hearing many guitarists of all type genres, all types of amps, guitars, stomp boxes, effects; there is only one David Gilmore. I’ve heard solo#2 played over and over through the years and it only gets deeper, richer, more passionate, cleaner and more amazing. Each time he played it, he uses the finest cherries of his career and pitches the lack luster ( if there is such a thing). It pulls the tears and your heart right out of you. 
My favorite is Live in Gnask shortly before Richards’ passing. David came across as the seasoned master that he is.
And now the Black Strat from Manny’s has been sold...but the song unashamedly plays on."

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Ok
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more (aaaaaahhhhh!)
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do…"

@snipesMcgipes25,He plays this solo with such passion its spine chilling. Cannot replicate or match the emotion. Just wow.
@gustavomason6891,David  Gilmour   ...tu  eres  Pink  Floyd..
@anibcastano2064,"Nobody, ever, will write or compose such a captivating solo perfection, as catching, as penetrating, as beautiful, as striking and different for collective memory. I have seen Gilmour four times on stage since 1994 and each time when this song arrives, something happens that you cannot explain ... It's a hymn to the madness of music, to the glittering melody ... to a generation privileged of people who had the happiness to attend such a moment of anthology in the history of the Mucic Rock. Forever indestructible. Hat the artist .... and don't try to write something stronger yet, it's not worth it : It's just impossible ! Thank you Mister David Gilmour."
@basketburger,This is porn
@MyTube4Utoo,"I've got a Strat., but mine seems to be defective, it didn't come with those notes."
@MyTube4Utoo,David doesn't 'shred' because - why would he?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are the only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are the only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb"
@uruguayespenarol,"I had the luck of hear this amazing song played in Bs.As by David and other here in Uruguay by Roger Waters, both with my father. Things that I will never forget!
THANK YOU"
@stillbill1878,"Anyone who believes that David Gilmour got lucky and joined Floyd at the perfect time is simply delusional.  If not for Gilmour, Pink Floyd would have been an anomaly in music history.  Waters owes Dave, not vice-versa.  David Gilmour has a seat at the table with the greatest composers in history. Bach would love this. This masterpiece is but a sampling of the genius of this man.   
Please go away with all the Malmsteen, Van Halen rhetoric.  They pale."

@johnthomas1422,Didn't Roger Waters write and perform this song originally on The Wall? Isn't David Gilmore just ripping off old Pink Floyd  not only by ripping this song but also doing live in Pompeii again?  Maybe I'm just bitter that Pink Floyd broke up and all of their solo work has been sub par.
